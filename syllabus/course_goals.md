# Course Syllabus

## Old Syllabus 

### Course Level Learning Goals

1.  Students will write computer programs to model and analyze data in the solid earth, atmospheric,
 and oceanographic sciences. This requires:

2.  Breaking problems into logical steps using flowcharts and pseudocode to specify algorithms: Operation; repetition; decision and input/output steps; computer math

3.  Writing and debugging MATLAB code to correctly implement algorithms: syntax and datastructures; debugging strategies

4.  Modifying existing MATLAB code,  using the elements of good programming style,  to make  it  more  efficient,  readable,  and  documented  for  future  use:  naming  conventions;appropriate syntax;  structures;  modularization using functions;  using built-in functions;code reuse; good documentation  practices; vectorization of loop operations

5.  Creating scientifically informative and visually appealing plots (scatterplots, time series,contours,  multiple subplots, legends)




##  New Syllabus Brainstorming 

HARD SKILLS:

- differentiate between and know the basic operations related to
  string, int, float, boolean, none, list, set, tuple, dictionary
- manipulate numpy array, pandas dataframe(?)
- make pretty plots
- define functions so you DRY (dont repeat yourself)
- use a shell or terminal to do stuff
- debug code
- google your way out of problems -- this is important
- develop a workflow that works BEYOND eosc211 -- i do all my hw assignments now in jupyter...

SOFT SKILLS:

- be confident going from earth/ocean/atmosphere -> numerical dataset -> code -> scientific conclusion
- appreciate computational principles and apply some of them: abstraction, efficiency, modularization
- understand the relationship between GUIs, high level languages, low level languages, assembly code
- foster an appropriate desire for efficient/elegant/pythonic code and fear/hatred of cludges without going overboard
- appreciate that there are many ways to solve a single problem and some are better than others
- confidence with viewing/using a computer like a programmer - shells/terminals, code, vocabulary like 'back end,' 'gui'

BIG PRINCIPLES:
- coding is hard and i feel like i have no idea what im doing and everyone is smarter than me. thats fine
- DRY and YANGNI
- Make it look good
- Keep your hard drive organized just like you would a lab bench
- namespaces are one honking great idea -- lets do more of those




 week | worksheets | lab
 ---  |--- |   --- |
 1| none | none
 2| algorithm design, intro to python, built in functions, data types | intro to jupyterlab (not yet created)

 5.5 | Assignment 1
 6| loops | filtering with running mean/median, implemented with loops (slow)
 7| MIDTERM
 8| functions | re-do lab 6 with functions
 9| debugging and error types (off by one, fencepost) | go through a "large" functional program, using dictionaries, `*args, **kwargs`

## things that arent in e211 that should be(?):

* formal discussion of objects
* pandas
* xarray
* geopandas -- for the gis students
* scipy for linalg, integrations
* DIY python, how to set up your own workflow
* shell tutorial
* timeit module
* numba?
* intro to git
* file IO with python
* datetime
