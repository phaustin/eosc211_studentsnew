# Dates and Times

## EOSC 211

**Week ? Day ?**

**Learning Objectives:**  
1. describe what the unix epoch is
2. convert from strings, unix epoch to arrow objects and back
3. use built in functions to calculate timedeltas

Very frequently we encounter *time series* data in the earth, ocean and atmospheric sciences. Here we will practice parsing dates and times with python, and use the *Arrow* library to convert between several different possible date and time formats. Finally, we will use our skills to generate a plot of a real dataset and do some calculations using *Arrow datetime objects.*

```python
import arrow
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
```

### Question 1

**Write today's date and the current time in 5 different ways. Which is the easiest to read for you? Which would be the easiest to parse with a computer?**


your answer here


**andrew's soln**

15:45 August 17th, 2021 << my favorite

2021-08-17 3:45pm 

1545.8.17.21

17/08/21 15:45:21 << probably easiest to compute? 

quarter to four in the afternoon on the seventeenth day of august in year of our lord, two thousand twenty one


### Question 2

**It turns out there isn't a definative "official" format for writing dates and times; over the years there have been many different strategies that have been developed for handling dates and times with a computer. One popular format is *UNIX time* (aka POSIX time, aka UNIX epoch), which is the number of seconds that have passed since 00:00 on January 1st, 1970. What is the current date/time written in UNIX epoch format? (Useful tools exist online to help you with this)**

### Question 3

**Python has several *packages* for handling dates and times and converting between formats. In this course, we will be using *Arrow*. Read the documentation [here](https://arrow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to get familiar with some of Arrow's build in functions, or type `help(arrow)` into a cell. Convert the following dates into *arrow date objects*:**


**Important Dates in History:**

My birthday: `763171200`

First Documented Coronavirus Case: `'November 17, 2019'`

SpaceX Inspiration 4 scheduled launch: `'0900 09/14/21'`

```python
# your code here
```

```python
# andrew's soln
# birthday
birthday = arrow.get(763171200)
birthday
```

```python
# covid 
covid_start = arrow.get('Nov 17, 2019', 'MMM DD, YYYY')
covid_start
```

```python
# spacex
launch = arrow.get('0900 09/14/21', 'hhmm MM/DD/YY')
launch
```

### Question 4

**How old are you (in years)? How long ago did the pandemic start (in years and days)? Find/display the answer using the built in `humanize()` function**

```python
# age
now = arrow.now('US/Pacific')
now.humanize(birthday, only_distance=True)
```

```python
# pandemic
covid_start.humanize(now, granularity=["year","day"])
```

```python
# get some timeseries data (hide this cell later)
# data is modified from AEROCAN station at Waskesiu, SK. (Andrew's research with Ian)
